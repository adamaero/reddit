message_subject: 'r/{{subreddit}} | Flair Syntax Error'
message: |
    Dear u/{{author}}!  
    The syntax of [your flair command]({{permalink}}) seems to be faulty.  
    
    ---  
    
    Your comment reads:  
    `{{body}}`  
    The syntax error was found in the term right after:  
    `{{match-2}}`

    Flair commands must...  
    - Be executed by the OP, or an approved submitter. Approved submitters can
    only flair submissions that haven't been flaired yet.  
    - Be comments that start with `++`.  
    - Consist of terms from 
    [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/{{subreddit}}/wiki/submission_flairs#list), 
    separated by single spaces.  
    - Be at most 64 characters long after the `++`. This includes spaces.  
    - Not include the same term twice.  
    A valid example: `++flair1 flair2 flair3`

message_subject: 'r/{{subreddit}} | Flair Duplicate Error'
message: |
    Dear u/{{author}}!  
    It looks like you are trying to use the same term twice in 
    [your flair command]({{permalink}}). This is not allowed.
    
    ---
    
    Your comment reads:  
    `{{body}}`  
    The identified duplicate term:  
    `{{match-3}}`

    Dear u/{{author}}!  
    The flair you are [trying to assign]({{permalink}}) is too long. 
    Flairs can only be 64 characters long.
